## Scope

nullkomma is **per-project** Nix scaffolding for devshells, formatters, checks, tasks, CI and editor settings, packaged as composable [flake-parts](https://flake.parts) modules.

It is **not**:

## Charter

This repo contributes to the broader IT infrastructure laid out in [aoshima](https://github.com/dataheld/aoshima).
When making changes, adhere to [aoshima's charter](https://github.com/dataheld/aoshima#charter).

## Installing

> [!TIP]
> The steps below are **system / user** prerequisites.
> Project-specific software is handled by the flake once you are inside the repo.

1. Install Nix (the package manager).
   The [Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) is recommended.

1. For automatic flake-shell activation, provide [direnv](https://direnv.net) and [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) in your user environment (managed via [lap](https://github.com/dataheld/lap) or installed manually).

   > [!TIP]
   > `nix-`/`direnv` can be a bit chatty on launch.
   > Set [`hide_env_diff=true`](https://direnv.net/man/direnv.toml.1.html) to quiet it down.

1. In your project, add a `flake.nix` from the `default` template:

   ```sh
   nix flake init --template "https://flakehub.com/f/dataheld/nullkomma/0.1.*#default"
   ```

   The template also includes `.envrc` containing `use flake`.
   Existing files are preserved.

1. Initialize remaining missing files (see below):

   ```sh
   git add flake.nix .envrc
   nix develop --command write-files
   nix develop --command generate-files
   ```

1. (one-time only) Inside the repo, run `direnv allow`.

> [!TIP]
> Windows is not supported by Nix,
> but you can use the
> [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

From now on, whenever you change into the directory of your project,
all the necessary dependencies etc. will be ready.
The first time you enter the directory, this might take some time.

## Using

Project tasks are plain commands in the development shell (they accept
arguments, e.g. `write-files --accept <path>`). The
[DeterminateSystems/up](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/up) runner lists
them and runs them without arguments:

```sh
tasks          # list tasks
tasks check    # run one task
tasks all      # run all tasks that don't change files
```

### Plugins

Everything nullkomma adds comes from **plugins**, exported as flake-parts modules
`flakeModules.<plugin>` next to the shared `flakeModules.framework`.
All plugins are optional; `nullkomma.lib.mkFlake` (or importing
`flakeModules.default` into your own `flake-parts.lib.mkFlake`) enables the
ones below by default, so you only list exceptions:

```nix
inputs.nullkomma.lib.mkFlake { inherit inputs; } {
  nullkomma.github.enable = false;
  nullkomma.markdown.enable = false;
}
```

¹ Tests are [bats](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io) files in `test/`
(`nullkomma.shell.bats.testDir`); the `test` task and check appear once that
directory exists. Add the tools tests need with
`perSystem.nullkomma.shell.bats.packages`. The check runs them in the sandbox
against the flake's source, with shebangs patched.

✅ means the plugin's files are formatted/linted by `nix fmt` and checked by
`nix flake check` (via treefmt). The exact tools are in the plugin's source.

### Knobs

Options live under `nullkomma.*`, for example:

```nix
inputs.nullkomma.lib.mkFlake { inherit inputs; } {
  nullkomma.github.ci.inputs.visibility = "public"; # publish to FlakeHub
  perSystem =
    { pkgs, ... }:
    {
      nullkomma.devshell.packages = [ pkgs.hello ];
      treefmt.programs.typos.enable = true;
    };
}
```

### Files in your repo

nullkomma keeps files in your repo to a minimum; features live in Nix instead.
Some tools still need real files (Git needs `.gitignore`, GitHub needs
workflows, editors need settings). Each such file is one of two kinds:

|                             | **Source of truth** (committed, yours to edit) | **Generated from Nix** (Git-ignored, don't edit) |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `nix flake init --template` | `flake.nix`, `.envrc`                          | (not possible)                                   |
| `write-files`               | `.gitignore`, GitHub workflows                 |                                                  |
| `generate-files`            |                                                | `.vscode/*.json`, `.nvim.lua`                    |

Templates can't take parameters, so anything that depends on your Nix
configuration comes from `write-files` or `generate-files`.

**Source-of-truth files** (`nullkomma.files."<path>".mode = "source"`, the
default) are written once, then they are yours: edit and commit them.
When nullkomma later changes a file, `write-files` updates it only if you
haven't edited it. Otherwise it keeps your version, saves the new one next to it
and fails, pointing you to the
[resolve-file-conflicts skill](.github/skills/resolve-file-conflicts/SKILL.md).
After resolving, `write-files --accept <path>` marks the file as up to date.

### Conflict-resolution skill

The repository root is a portable [Agent Plugins 1.0 package](https://agent-plugin.org/en).
Install it from this Git repository in a compatible client. In Copilot, run:

```text
/plugin install https://github.com/dataheld/nullkomma
```

Update it with `/plugin update nullkomma`. Installing or updating the plugin
does not write to the consumer project, so its source-of-truth edits remain
untouched.

**Generated files** (`mode = "generated"`) always come from Nix.
`generate-files` overwrites them on every run, starts them with a
"do not edit" comment and the `git` plugin adds them to `.gitignore`.
To change one, change the Nix options.

`update` updates `flake.lock` and then runs both commands. After any other
`nix flake update` (e.g. by a bot), run `write-files` and `generate-files`
yourself.

### Editors

Editor settings live in Nix. Plugins describe their language servers once,
editor-neutrally (`nullkomma.editor.languageServers`), plus anything only one
editor has (e.g. `nullkomma.editor.vscode.extensions`). Editor plugins (`vscode`,
`neovim`) write these out as generated, Git-ignored files, so every developer
gets support for their editor without committing editor config.
Neovim reads `.nvim.lua` only with `:set exrc` and asks once to trust it.
The editor plugins match the editors [lap](https://github.com/dataheld/lap)
sets up: VS Code and Neovim.

nullkomma only handles **project-specific** editor features: language servers,
formatters and recommended extensions. Installing editors and extensions, themes,
keybindings and personal preferences belong to your user environment, e.g.
[lap](https://github.com/dataheld/lap).

### Development Shell

After changing `flake.nix`, run `direnv reload` (or `nix-direnv-reload`) to
update your shell.

## Design

Plugins never read each other's options. Values shared between plugins are
framework options that any plugin may set or read. For example, `treefmt` sets
`nullkomma.editor.formatCommand` and the `nix` language server uses it, without
knowing which plugin set it. Another formatter plugin can replace `treefmt`
without changing `nix`.

## Development

Before building something, check [flake.parts](https://flake.parts) for an
existing module; see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Inputs only nullkomma's own
development needs go in [`dev/flake.nix`](dev/flake.nix), so they stay out of
projects' `flake.lock`.

### Testing nullkomma

nullkomma is tested against small example projects ("fixtures") in
`tests/fixtures`, which use nullkomma the way a real project would.
All tests are in [`modules/dev/tests.nix`](modules/dev/tests.nix); projects using
nullkomma don't inherit them.

- **Unit tests** ([nix-unit](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-unit)) check
  the evaluated configuration of the fixtures, e.g. that every plugin can be
  switched off and that all off leaves just the framework.
- **Docs test:** `options-doc` renders every option the way
  [flake.parts](https://flake.parts) would, so each needs a description.
- **Build tests** run the real tools on the fixtures inside `nix flake check`:
  valid files must pass, and for every formatter/linter plugin a deliberately
  bad file (listed in `rejects`) must fail with that tool's error.
- **End-to-end test:** `check-fixtures` copies a fixture to a temporary
  directory and runs `nix flake check` there (with valid and bad files), exactly
  as a user would, against this checkout of nullkomma. The other tests evaluate fixtures from within
  nullkomma's own flake, so only this one catches problems with
  how a real project fetches and uses nullkomma. CI runs it on every push.

```sh
nix flake check   # unit, docs and build tests
check-fixtures    # end-to-end test
```

New plugins should add a valid and a deliberately broken fixture, and check that
the broken one fails with the real tool's error, not just any error.
